# Search DS IDE Toolkit

An AI-inspired web app tailored for search intelligence (e.g., Bing) that centralizes data science workflows: data intake, standardized metrics, experiment design, reporting/alerting, and planning/goaling. It comes preloaded with two North Star metrics—**Search Relevance** and **AI Adoption**—to ground analysis in search-specific outcomes.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
2. Upload a CSV/TSV/JSON file of search logs/ranking events **or** provide a URL to load data.
3. Explore automated data quality stats, capture search relevance + AI adoption metrics, design experiments, run alert scans, and size initiatives.

## Features
- **Initial data cleaning & EDA**: quick row/column counts, missingness, numeric profiling, and preview table.
- **Metrics framework**: capture search relevance and AI adoption as North Star metrics alongside P0–P2 supporting measures with trade-offs and eval alignment.
- **Experiment framework**: generate design briefs for ranking/reranking/generative search, approximate power analysis, and LLM-styled readouts with go/no-go rules.
- **Reporting & alerting**: dashboard cards, holdout controls, spike/drift scans, and auto-generated summaries for search metrics.
- **Planning & goaling**: impact/effort sizing, priority scoring, and goal projections tied to search outcomes.
